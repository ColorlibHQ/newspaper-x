# Repository clone/download :fire: :fire: :fire:

This repository contains a git sub-module and as such, can not be completely downloaded using the web-interface of GitHub. This is a known limitation of GitHub's own tools. However, cloning this repository via CLI works absolutely fine and will pull all sub-modules as long as you use the proper commands. 

Here's a short tutorial on how to achieve this as well as a better explanation of what Git sub-modules are and how they're useful: https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255
